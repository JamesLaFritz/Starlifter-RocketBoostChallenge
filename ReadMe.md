## Title

**Starlifter: Rocket Boost Challenge**

## Tagline / Short Description

*‚ÄúPrecision thrust. Perfect landings. Beat the hazards.‚Äù*

## Detailed Description

**Starlifter: Rocket Boost Challenge** is a 2.5D skill-based physics game inspired by classic lunar-lander gameplay and built during the GameDev.tv ‚ÄúRocket Boost‚Äù section. Players pilot a small rocket craft through increasingly challenging environments filled with hazards, moving platforms, and tight spaces.
The core experience is about **precision** and **control**: carefully managing thrust, rotation, and inertia to land safely on designated pads while avoiding obstacles.

* **Objective:** Navigate from launch point to landing pad to complete each level.
* **Core Mechanics:**
  * **Rotation & Thrust:** Player controls left/right rotation and upward thrust with limited fuel.
  * **Physics-based flight:** Momentum, gravity, and collisions determine success.
  * **Hazards & Moving Elements:** Platforms, oscillating obstacles, and environmental features test skill.
* **Progression:** Sequential levels of increasing difficulty.
* **Tone & Style:** Bright, low-poly sci-fi aesthetic (GameDev.tv assets), clean UI, and satisfying particle/audio feedback.
* **Player Experience Goals:**
  * Feel tension and satisfaction mastering tight controls.
  * Feel skill progression from early easy levels to complex ‚Äúdocking‚Äù challenges.
  * Enjoy snappy audio-visual feedback (‚Äújuice‚Äù) for every action.

**Platform:** Unity WebGL build for Itch.io (playable in-browser with keyboard and gamepad).

## Branding Ideas for Rocket + Itch.io Page Art

* Use screenshots or GIFs of the rocket flying through levels.
* Use a short 15‚Äì30s clip of a level completion for the page banner.
* Brand the game as a ‚Äúpolished student project‚Äù with extra features.

Based on your screenshot (white pod with blue glow, red sky, blue towers):

* **Logo:** ‚ÄúStarlifter‚Äù in bold, rounded sans serif, white letters with a neon blue outline, small yellow thruster flame icon above the ‚Äúi‚Äù.
